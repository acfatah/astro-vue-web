# Astro + Vue 3 Static Web Generator

Opinionated Astro + Vue 3 static web generator with Tailwind CSS.

```bash
npx degit acfatah/astro-vue-web my-website && \
  cd my-website && \
  npm install
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

We put our Vue componenets in `src/components/`.

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                       |
